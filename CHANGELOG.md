## [0.3.13] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- Avoid blocking I/O on the event loop during config-entry restore (W1N-208): preload matrix-nio version and SAS patch imports at `nio_compat` module load, and run `restore_login` via `asyncio.to_thread`.

### Fixed

- Restore `ruff format --check` compliance in `client.py` (drop redundant parentheses around comma-separated `except` clauses).

- Expand README with v0.3.10 alignment: TOC, error-code table, Connection diagnostics, URL normalization rules, automation examples.
- Add DEVICE_VERIFICATION troubleshooting for `session_corrupt` / `restore_failed`.
- Add `SECURITY.zh.md` and sync EN/ZH security and migration notes.
- Complete DEVELOPMENT test inventory and NIO upgrade checklist.
- Polish migration wording and changelog dates.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-08-19
